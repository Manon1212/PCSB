The aim of this project is to recreate the computational part of the paper "Simple reaction times of ipsilateral and contralateral hand to lateralized visual stimuli" (Berlucchi and al., 1971)'s experimental setting.  

The study "Simple reaction times of ipsilateral and contralateral hand to lateralized visual stimuli" devotes attention to the neural pathway connecting visual and motor areas during visuomotor tasks. In particular, Berlucchi and colleagues tested two hypothesis. First-of-all, crossed reactions should be faster than uncrossed one ; that is, for a given the visuomotor task, the hand  should be faster if the stimuli is lateralized on the same side (uncrossed reaction), as opposed to controlateral (crossed reaction). Moreover, the authors expect reaction-time difference between crossed and uncrossed conditions to increase with distance of the stimuli from the vertical meridian. 

These hypothesis were tested by an experimental setting which proceeded as following : a square of light flashes at different angles (5°, 20°, 35°) from the center, on the horizontal meridian, on the left and right hemispheres. The subjects react by pressing one of the two dedicated keys by either the left or the right hand. Reaction times are recorded.
